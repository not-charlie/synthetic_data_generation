Project Goal
This project will explore the concepts of modeling and simulation using Python. The goal is to gain hands-on 
experience with Python libraries and tools (such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.) commonly 
used for modeling and simulation tasks.

Synthetic Data Modeling (General Application)
This project involves creating a synthetic dataset and applying modeling and simulation techniques to it.
• Focus: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying standard modeling 
techniques (e.g., regression, classification, time series).
• Task:
1. Generate a synthetic dataset with known properties (e.g., specific distributions, correlations) using 
libraries like numpy and scikit-learn.
2. Perform EDA to "discover" the characteristics of your data.
3. Apply a suitable modeling technique (scikit-learn, statsmodels, tensorflow) to the data.
4. Use the fitted model to generate simulated outcomes or predictions.
5. Evaluate the model's performance by comparing simulated outcomes against the original data's 
known properties.
